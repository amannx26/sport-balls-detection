 # How it works?
 creating a classifier to distinguish 7 sport balls with ResNet-18 and Jetson Inference, the algorithm includes steps like collecting data, training the model, and using it to classify images.

 ## How to do this??
Steps to run :  
 1. You have to install jetson inteference and Docker from https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/building-repo-2.md
 2.run the training script and Change directories into jetson-inference/python/training/classification/data
 3.Run this command to download the dataset
   wget https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/o577zd8yp3lmxf5zhm38svrbrv45am3y.gz -O cat_dog.tar.gz
 4.Run this command to unzip the file you downloaded.
   tar xvzf cat_dog.tar.gz
 5.cd back to nvidia/jetson-inference/
 6.To prevent potential memory errors later on, ensure your system can allocate more memory for tasks by running this command in your terminal while    in the jetson-inference directory.
   echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
 7. After completing the previous step in the jetson-inference folder, execute ./docker/run.sh to start the docker container. You may need to re-  
    enter your NVIDIA password during this process.
 8. From inside the Docker container, change directories so you are in jetson-inference/python/training/classification
 9. To train the network using the training script, specify the --model-dir where the model should be saved and the path to your data directory.    
    Hereâ€™s an example command with additional options for batch size, workers, and epochs:
    python3 train.py --model-dir=models/sportballs data/sportballs --batch-size=32 --workers=4 --epochs=50
    Explanation of the options:
    --model-dir=models/cat_dog: Specifies the directory where the trained model will be saved.
    data/cat_dog: Path to the directory containing your training data.
    --batch-size=32: Sets the number of samples in each batch during training. Adjust this based on your system's memory capacity and training 
       dataset size.
    --workers=4: Number of worker processes to use for data loading during training. Increasing this can speed up data processing if your system 
       supports it.
    --epochs=50: Number of complete passes through the training dataset. Adjust based on how many iterations of training you want to perform.
